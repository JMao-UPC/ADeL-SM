# U-Net Video Restoration for PD-L1 Experimental Data
A PyTorch-based U-Net implementation for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) video restoration, optimized for PD-L1 immunofluorescence experimental data. The workflow includes **blob detection**, **automatic label generation**, **model training**, and **full-video inference**â€”all with configurable parameters for adaptability to different datasets.
