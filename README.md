## 📚 Overview
---
ADeL-SM is an adaptive deep learning framework designed to enhance single-molecule fluorescence imaging. By combining advanced denoising strategies with precise localization algorithms, it significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio and localization accuracy, enabling reliable quantitative analysis of molecular dynamics. The method has been validated on simulated and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to preserve single-molecule signals even under high-density and low-SNR conditions.
